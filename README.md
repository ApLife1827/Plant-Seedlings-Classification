# Plant-Seedlings-Classification
## Dataset
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a <a href="https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset">dataset</a> containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.

I took Kaggle's "Plant seedlings classification" <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data">dataset</a>. and use the cnn model.
